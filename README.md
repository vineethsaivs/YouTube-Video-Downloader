Tkinter is the Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

pytube is a lightweight, dependency-free Python library which is used for downloading videos from the web. And we use YouTube which is imported from pytube to download YouTube videos especially.

The downloaded video will be present at the location of the python file itself. For example, if the python file which you are about to run is present on the desktop, the downloaded vidoe will also be present on the desktop itself.
